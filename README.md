<h3>Agiledrop site made with Bootstrap</h3>

<p>
  This is <a href="https://www.agiledrop.si/">Agiledrop</a> home page re-created with Bootstrap 5. The sole purpose of this forked web page is to show the company my computer programming skills like HTML, CSS and JS with Bootstrap framework.

I've added some minor changes like animations just for fun. I apologise for the code being a little messy, as I was battling with some problems with layouts and their positions in order to make the site look as close as the original.

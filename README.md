<h3>Agiledrop site made with Bootstrap</h3>

<p>
  This is <a href="https://www.agiledrop.si/">Agiledrop</a> home page re-created with Bootstrap 5. The sole purpose of this forked web page is to show the company my computer programming skills like HTML, CSS and JS with Bootstrap framework.

<p>
I've add some minor changes like animations just for fun. I apologise for the code being a little messy, as I was battling with some layouts and their positions to make the site look as close as the original.
